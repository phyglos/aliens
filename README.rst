The aliens Catalog
==================

The aliens Catalog is BANDIT catalog, a set of bundles and their corresponding
origins, that can be used with the BANDIT toolkit to install third party binary
products in a system.

The catalog is provided for user's convenience. The use of this catalog for
installing binary bundles in a system implies fully trusting the creators of
these packages and their binary code. The bundles included in this catalog do
not contain the actual binaries, just the recipes to help install these packages
in an automated way.

See the documentation of each third party product for their own terms and
conditions before installing. Some packages require a previous acceptance of
their licenses and terms. In some cases, the user is responsible for downloading
the binary package and copying it into the **BANDIT_DOWNLOADS** directory before
using the BANDIT to install it.
